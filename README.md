# Nextgen-Indeed
First Epitech project, create the new Indeed

## HTML Pages
In this part we created 6 pages :
- **acceuil.html**
- **create_annonces.html**
- **see_my_annonces.html**
- **Profile.html**
- **sign-in.html**
- **sign-up.html**

We use the framework **Bootstrap**.

For most of the pages we added small javascript script for a more dynamic page :
- **Apply.js** this sscript is for the pages *acceuil.html* and *see_my_annonces.html* for our job adverts
- **modify.js** this script is for the *Profile* page, the user will be able to modify is info.
- **salary.js**  this script is for the *create an annonces* page so that RH who is creating is advert can easly choose the salary with the boostrap range and the script display it.
