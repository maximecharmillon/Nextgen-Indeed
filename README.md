_______________________________________________________________________________________________

## HTML Pages
In this part we created 6 pages :
- **acceuil.html**
- **create_annonces.html**
- **see_my_annonces.html**
- **Profile.html**
- **sign-in.html**
- **sign-up.html**

________________________________________________________________________________________________

*acceuil.html* and *see_my_annonces.html* are mostly to display th adverts.
*create_annonces* is to create an annonce if the user is a HR for exemple.
*Profile.html* display the user info and it can be modify.
*sign-in.html* and *sign-up.html* are to login or sign up.
We use the framework **Bootstrap**.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

For most of the pages we added small javascript script for a more dynamic page :
- **Apply.js** this sscript is for the pages *acceuil.html* and *see_my_annonces.html* for our job adverts
- **modify.js** this script is for the *Profile* page, the user will be able to modify is info.
- **salary.js**  this script is for the *create an annonces* page so that HR who is creating is advert can easly choose the salary with the boostrap range and the script display it.
